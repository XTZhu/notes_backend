## requests/... 下的 rest 文件  

[√]要用到 vscode 插件 **REST Client**，
> 使用方法:  Once you prepared a request, click the Send Request link above the request (this will appear if the file's language mode is HTTP, by default .http files are like this), or use shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+R(Cmd+Alt+R for macOS)**, or right-click in the editor and then select Send Request in the menu, or press F1 and then select/type Rest Client: Send Request, the response will be previewed in a separate webview panel of Visual Studio Code. If you'd like to use the full power of searching, selecting or manipulating in Visual Studio Code, you can also preview response in an untitled document by setting rest-client.previewResponseInUntitledDocument to true. Once a request is issued, the waiting spin icon will be displayed in the status bar until the response is received. You can click the spin icon to cancel the request. After that, the icon will be replaced with the total duration and response size.
